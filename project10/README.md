# Course 2 Project 10

Project 9 involves building the lexical analyser and parser for the Jack lanaguage compiler. The output of project 10 is 2 XML files per Jack file where the first XML file simply lists all tokens found by the tokenizer (lexer), and the second XML file displays the entire parse tree structure of the Jack class.

Refer to the [n2t](../n2t/README.md) CLI tool for usage examples.
